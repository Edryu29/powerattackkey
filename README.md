## 🤺 Consecutive Attacks

Enable consecutive attacks and the time between activations.
If your attack speed is too fast and combos don't work, you can reduce the delay so the attack action is called more frequent.

> bConsecutiveLightAttacks = 0

> fConsecutiveAttacksDelay = 0.5

## 🥛 Stamina

If enabled, you need the configured amount of stamina to trigger power attacks.
> bPowerAttacksRequireStamina = 0

> iStaminaCost1H = 15

> iStaminaCost2H = 30
